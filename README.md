# Docker Tutorial - Debian Stretch

Welcome to the Docker Tutorial of [Ruby on Racetracks](http://www.rubyonracetracks.com/)!  This is the tutorial for the Ruby on Racetracks way of getting started in Docker.  Please note that I am using Docker as a replacement for Vagrant.  Instead of having a different Docker container for each capability (such as one for PostgreSQL, one for Rails, etc.), I prefer to have all the software I need pre-installed and pre-configured in the Docker image.

## Prerequisites
* You should have version 4 of SparkyLinux installed as your host OS or virtual OS.  You may also use any other Linux distro based on Debian Stretch.
* If you are using a Mac or Windows, you can use a VirtualBox virtual machine with SparkyLinux on it.  For more details, go through my [VirtualBox Tutorial](https://github.com/jhsu802701/tutorial_virtualbox).

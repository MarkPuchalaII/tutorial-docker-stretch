# Chapter 4: Using the Jekyll Image

In this chapter, you will use the rbenv-jekyll Docker image.  It's based on the development image but has a version of Ruby installed and a version of the Jekyll gem, which is used for creating static web sites.

## What's the point?
This chapter demonstrates the use of port forwarding for viewing web pages locally.

## Downloading the Image
* Entering the following commands in a terminal in your host system:
```
cd
cd jhsu802701
cd docker-debian-stretch # Back to the docker-debian-stretch repository from the previous chapter
```
